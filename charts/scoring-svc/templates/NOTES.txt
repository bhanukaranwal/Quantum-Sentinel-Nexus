The QSN Scoring Service (scoring-svc) has been deployed successfully.

This is a high-performance, low-latency gRPC service responsible for real-time
fraud risk prediction.

1. To check the status of the deployment, run:
  kubectl get deployments -l "app.kubernetes.io/name={{ include "scoring-svc.name" . }}"

2. To see the pod logs, run:
  export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l "app.kubernetes.io/name={{ include "scoring-svc.name" . }},app.kubernetes.io/instance={{ .Release.Name }}" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
  kubectl --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} logs -f $POD_NAME

3. This service is available within the cluster at the following DNS address and port:
   {{ include "scoring-svc.fullname" . }}.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local:{{ .Values.service.port }}

Other services, like the auth-gateway, can use this address to send gRPC requests for scoring.
