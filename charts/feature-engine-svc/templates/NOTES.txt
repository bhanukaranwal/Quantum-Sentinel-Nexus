The QSN Feature Engine Service (feature-engine-svc) has been deployed successfully.

This service is a background worker that consumes messages from the '{{ .Values.env.INPUT_TOPIC }}' Kafka topic,
engineers features, and publishes the results to the '{{ .Values.env.OUTPUT_TOPIC }}' topic.

It does not expose any network ports.

You can monitor its activity by checking the pod logs:

  export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l "app.kubernetes.io/name={{ include "feature-engine-svc.name" . }},app.kubernetes.io/instance={{ .Release.Name }}" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
  kubectl --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} logs -f $POD_NAME

When the ingestion-svc receives data, you should see log messages here indicating that
messages are being consumed and processed.
