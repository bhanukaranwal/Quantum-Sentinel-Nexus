The QSN Compliance Service (compliance-svc) has been deployed successfully.

This service is a background worker that consumes alerts from Kafka and evaluates
them against a set of compliance rules using the Drools rules engine.

1. To check the status of the deployment, run:
  kubectl get deployments -l "app.kubernetes.io/name={{ include "compliance-svc.name" . }}"

2. To see the pod logs, which will show consumed Kafka messages and rule engine activity, run:
  export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l "app.kubernetes.io/name={{ include "compliance-svc.name" . }},app.kubernetes.io/instance={{ .Release.Name }}" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
  kubectl --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} logs -f $POD_NAME

3. The service's health endpoint can be checked internally via its service port:
   {{ include "compliance-svc.fullname" . }}:{{ .Values.service.port }}/actuator/health

This service does not have a public-facing ingress but its health is monitored
by Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes.
