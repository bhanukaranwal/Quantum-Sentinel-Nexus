The QSN Edge Node Agent (edge-node-agent) has been deployed successfully as a DaemonSet.

This agent is designed to run on specific edge nodes within your cluster that have
access to local data and specialized hardware (e.g., GPUs).

1. To verify that the agent pods are running on the correct nodes, first find the
   node selector labels defined in your values.yaml file:
   Node Selector: {{ .Values.nodeSelector | toYaml | nindent 4 }}

2. List the nodes that match these labels:
   kubectl get nodes --selector={{ range $key, $val := .Values.nodeSelector }}{{ $key }}={{ $val }}{{ end }}

3. You should see one 'edge-node-agent' pod running on each of the nodes listed above.
   Verify this by running:
   kubectl get pods --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l "app.kubernetes.io/name={{ include "edge-node-agent.name" . }}" -o wide

4. To see the logs from an agent on a specific node, get the pod name and run:
   export POD_NAME=<pod-name-from-previous-command>
   kubectl --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} logs -f $POD_NAME

The agent will now wait to be called by the FL Coordinator to participate in a training round.
