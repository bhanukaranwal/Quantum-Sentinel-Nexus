The QSN Federated Learning Coordinator Service (fl-coordinator-svc) has been deployed successfully.

This service is the brain of the federated learning pipeline. It orchestrates training
rounds with participating edge nodes, securely aggregates model updates, and commits
the new model versions to the blockchain.

1. To check the status of the deployment, run:
  kubectl get deployments -l "app.kubernetes.io/name={{ include "fl-coordinator-svc.name" . }}"

2. To see the pod logs, which will show the status of federated rounds, run:
  export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l "app.kubernetes.io/name={{ include "fl-coordinator-svc.name" . }},app.kubernetes.io/instance={{ .Release.Name }}" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
  kubectl --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} logs -f $POD_NAME

3. This service is available within the cluster at the following DNS address and port:
   {{ include "fl-coordinator-svc.fullname" . }}.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local:{{ .Values.service.port }}

Edge agents will connect to this address to participate in training rounds.
