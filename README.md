The cryptography that protects global finance today relies on mathematical problems that are impossibly hard for classical computers to solve. The dawn of quantum computing, however, threatens to shatter these defenses, placing decades of sensitive financial data at risk.Quantum Sentinel Nexus (QSN) is our answer to this threat. It is not merely a fraud detection platform; it is a fortress, engineered from the ground up to future-proof the financial ecosystem. By combining the principles of decentralized collaboration, privacy-preserving AI, and quantum-resistant cryptography, QSN provides a new paradigm for security and trust.‚ú® Core FeaturesFeatureDescriptionüõ°Ô∏è Quantum-Resistant SecurityAll inter-service communication is shielded from quantum attacks using CRYSTALS-Kyber and Dilithium for post-quantum mTLS.üß† Federated Machine LearningCollaboratively train powerful AI models on decentralized datasets without ever centralizing or exposing sensitive raw data.üîí Privacy by DesignModel updates are cryptographically secured with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC).‚ö° Ultra-Low Latency ScoringA high-performance Rust-based gRPC service achieves real-time transaction scoring with <5ms P95 latency.‚õìÔ∏è Immutable GovernanceA Hyperledger Fabric blockchain provides a tamper-proof, auditable ledger for model versions, critical alerts, and consortium governance.‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud-Native & AgnosticThe entire 14-microservice architecture is containerized and orchestrated via Kubernetes, deployable on any major cloud provider or on-premises.üöÄ Getting Started: One Command to LaunchThe entire QSN stack can be deployed locally with a single command. This script installs the qsnctl CLI and bootstraps the full development environment, including a KinD Kubernetes cluster and all services.# This script will download qsnctl and run 'qsnctl dev-up'
curl -sSL [https://get.qsn.dev](https://get.qsn.dev) | bash
This command automates the entire setup process, allowing you to go from a clean machine to a fully running, 14-service distributed system in minutes.üõ†Ô∏è Technology StackQSN is built with a polyglot, best-tool-for-the-job philosophy.CategoryTechnologyBackendGo, Rust, Python, Node.js, C++, Kotlin, ScalaFrontendNext.js 14, React, Tailwind CSS, RechartsBlockchainHyperledger Fabric 3.x (SmartBFT)Post-Quantum CryptoCRYSTALS-Kyber (KEM), CRYSTALS-Dilithium (Signatures)Confidential AIFHE (Microsoft SEAL), MPC (SPDZ), Differential PrivacyData & MessagingKafka, Pulsar, Cassandra, Neo4j, Redis, MinIOInfrastructureKubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Helm, IstioDevEx & Toolingqsnctl (Rust CLI), Tilt, Dev Containers, Gitpod, TaskfileüèõÔ∏è Architecture OverviewQSN is an event-driven system built around a central Kafka message bus.

Ingestion: The auth-gateway-svc secures and proxies transactions to the ingestion-svc, which publishes them to Kafka.Enrichment: The feature-engine-svc consumes raw transactions, calculates ML features, and publishes enriched data back to Kafka.Scoring: The scoring-svc consumes enriched data, applies the global ML model, and publishes high-risk alerts.Alerting: The alert-router-svc consumes alerts and broadcasts them to the dashboard-ui via WebSockets.Federated Learning: The fl-coordinator-svc orchestrates training rounds with edge-node-agents, securely aggregates the results, and logs the new model version to the audit-svc blockchain.ü§ù ContributingThe Quantum Sentinel Nexus is built on the power of collaboration.
