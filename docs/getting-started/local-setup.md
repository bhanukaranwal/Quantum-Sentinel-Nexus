Getting Started: Local SetupThis guide will walk you through setting up a complete, self-contained Quantum Sentinel Nexus development environment on your local machine.PrerequisitesBefore you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed and configured on your system. These are standard tools for modern cloud-native development.Docker Desktop: Provides the container runtime and the Docker engine.kubectl: The command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.Kind: A tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container "nodes".Helm: The package manager for Kubernetes.!!! tip "Verify Your Setup"You can check if the tools are installed correctly by running their version commands:bash docker --version kubectl version --client kind --version helm version 1. The One-Command SetupThe entire local environment, including the qsnctl CLI, can be installed and started with a single command. This script downloads the latest qsnctl binary for your OS, places it in your path, and then runs qsnctl dev-up to bootstrap the environment.curl -sSL [https://get.qsn.dev](https://get.qsn.dev) | bash
This command will:Detect your operating system.Download the appropriate qsnctl binary.Make the binary executable and move it to /usr/local/bin (you may be prompted for your password).Run qsnctl dev-up, which starts the process detailed below.2. What qsnctl dev-up DoesThe qsnctl dev-up command is the heart of the local development experience. It automates the entire setup process:Checks Prerequisites: Verifies that Docker, kubectl, Kind, and Tilt are installed.Creates KinD Cluster: It spins up a local Kubernetes cluster named qsn-dev using Kind. This cluster is defined in infra/local-dev/kind-cluster.yaml and includes port mappings for accessing services.Starts Tilt: It launches Tilt, a tool for managing development environments on Kubernetes. Tilt reads the Tiltfile in the root of the project and takes over from here.Tilt will then:Deploy all the infrastructure dependencies (Kafka, Neo4j, etc.) using the qsn-infra Helm chart.Build the Docker image for each of the 14 microservices.Deploy each microservice to the KinD cluster using its respective Helm chart.Set up port-forwarding so you can access services from localhost.Watch for file changes and automatically rebuild and redeploy services as you code, enabling a fast live-reload workflow.You will see a web UI from Tilt (usually at http://localhost:10350) that shows the status of all services.3. Verifying the EnvironmentOnce qsnctl dev-up has finished and the Tilt UI shows all services are green, you can verify that the environment is running correctly:Check Kubernetes Pods:kubectl get pods -n default
You should see pods running for all the QSN services and infrastructure components.Access the Dashboard:Open your browser and navigate to the main dashboard URL defined in the Helm chart:http://qsn.localCheck the API Gateway:Send a request to the gateway's health endpoint:curl [http://api.qsn.local/](http://api.qsn.local/)
You should receive a status message from
