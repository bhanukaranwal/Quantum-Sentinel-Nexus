Tutorial: 0 â†’ Fraud Alert in 15 MinutesThis tutorial will guide you through a complete, end-to-end workflow of the Quantum Sentinel Nexus platform. You will start the system, generate a stream of synthetic transaction data, and see a real-time fraud alert appear on the dashboard.Time to complete: ~15 minutesPrerequisitesBefore you start, you must have a fully running local environment. If you haven't done so already, please complete the Local Setup guide.Step 1: Ensure the System is RunningIf you've just completed the local setup, your environment should be up and running. If not, open your terminal and start the entire QSN stack:qsnctl dev-up
Wait for the Tilt UI (at http://localhost:10350) to show that all services are green and ready.Step 2: Open the DashboardNavigate to the QSN Dashboard in your web browser. Based on our setup, the URL is:http://qsn.localYou should see the dashboard interface with KPIs at "0" and no alerts in the "Real-Time Alerts" table. Keep this window open and visible.Step 3: Generate Synthetic Transaction DataNow, let's generate some data. The payments-simulator service is designed for this purpose. We'll use the qsnctl CLI to trigger it.Open a new terminal window (do not stop the qsnctl dev-up process) and run the following command:qsnctl demo-data --count 5000 --time 60s
This command instructs the simulator to:Generate 5000 synthetic transactions.Spread the load over a 60-second period.You will see logs in your terminal indicating that the Locust load test has started.Step 4: Observe the Pipeline in ActionWith the data generator running, data is now flowing through the QSN pipeline. Here's what's happening behind the scenes:payments-simulator: Sends thousands of HTTP POST requests to the ingestion-svc.ingestion-svc: Receives these requests and publishes each transaction as a message to the txn-raw Kafka topic.feature-engine-svc: Consumes from txn-raw, adds ML features to each transaction, and publishes the enriched data to the features Kafka topic.scoring-svc: Consumes from features, runs the fraud detection model against the transaction, and if the risk score is high, publishes a message to the alerts Kafka topic.alert-router-svc: Consumes from the alerts topic and broadcasts the alert over a WebSocket.Step 5: See the Real-Time Alert!Switch back to your browser window with the QSN Dashboard.Within a few seconds, you should see the "Real-Time Alerts" table populate with new entries as the scoring-svc identifies high-risk transactions from the simulated data. The KPI cards at the top of the dashboard will also update to reflect the new activity.Congratulations! You have successfully simulated, processed, and detected a fraudulent transaction in real-time.Step 6: Clean UpOnce you are finished, you can shut down the entire local environment to free up system resources. Go back to the terminal where qsnctl dev-up is running and press Ctrl+C to stop Tilt.Then, run the shutdown command:qsnctl dev-down
This will delete the local KinD
