Getting Started: OverviewWelcome to the Quantum Sentinel Nexus (QSN). This document provides a high-level overview of the platform's purpose, core concepts, and key components.The Problem: Collaborative Fraud Detection is HardFinancial institutions individually possess vast amounts of data, but fraud schemes are often sophisticated and span across multiple organizations. An individual bank might only see one piece of a larger puzzle.Effective collaboration is hindered by major challenges:Data Privacy: Sharing raw, sensitive customer transaction data with competitors is a non-starter due to regulatory constraints (like GDPR, CCPA) and business confidentiality.Security: A centralized "fraud database" would become a massive target for attackers.Trust: How can competing institutions trust that shared data is used ethically and that the collaborative model is fair?The Solution: Decentralized, Privacy-Preserving AIQSN solves these problems by creating a decentralized ecosystem where participants can collaborate without ever sharing their raw data.Here's how it works at a high level:Local Training: Each participating bank uses its own private data to train a local version of a shared fraud detection model. This happens behind their own firewall on an Edge Node Agent.Encrypted Updates: Instead of sharing data, the banks share encrypted learnings from their data. The mathematical updates (gradients) from the local training are encrypted using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).Secure Aggregation: The central FL Coordinator receives these encrypted updates. Using FHE and Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC), it aggregates them into a single, improved "global model" updateâ€”all without ever decrypting the individual contributions.Blockchain Governance: The new global model's version and its cryptographic hash are committed to a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. This creates an immutable, tamper-proof audit trail of how the model evolves, ensuring transparency and trust among all participants.Real-Time Scoring: The updated global model is distributed to all participants, who use it to score new transactions in real-time with ultra-low latency.!!! success "The Core Principle"With QSN, you don't bring the data to the model; you bring the model to the data. This fundamental shift is the key to enabling secure and private collaboration.
Key TechnologiesFederated Learning (FL): A machine learning technique that enables model training on decentralized data.Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC): Secures all network communication against the threat of future quantum computers using CRYSTALS-Kyber and Dilithium.Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE): Allows computations (like summing up model updates) to be performed on encrypted data.Hyperledger Fabric: A private, permissioned blockchain that provides a trusted, auditable ledger for governance.Ready to see it in action?
