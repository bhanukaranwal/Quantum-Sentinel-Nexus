Welcome to the Quantum Sentinel NexusA quantum-secure, consortium-grade, federated fraud-detection ecosystem.Quantum Sentinel Nexus (QSN) is a next-generation platform designed for financial institutions to collaboratively combat fraud without compromising data privacy or security. This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to its architecture, development, and operation.!!! tip "New to QSN?"Check out the **[Getting Started Overview](getting-started/overview.md)** to understand the core concepts, or jump right into the **[0 â†’ Alert in 15 Min Tutorial](getting-started/tutorial.md)** to get a hands-on feel for the platform.

We use advanced cryptographic techniques like FHE and MPC to train models on encrypted data.Developer Experience: A streamlined, single-command setup, live-reloading, and comprehensive tooling are provided to ensure developers can be productive from day one.
